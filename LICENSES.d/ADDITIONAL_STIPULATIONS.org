* License Addendum – Plaintext Restriction

This project is licensed under the *Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial
4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)* license, *supplemented by the following
additional stipulations, which shall prevail in case of conflict.*

For the purposes of this Addendum:
- "Strict plaintext" means UTF-8 encoded text without markup other than what is
  explicitly permitted in Section 3.
- "Redistribution" means any act of sharing, copying, transmitting, or making
  available the Licensed Material to third parties, whether privately or
  publicly.

** 1. Redistribution

Redistribution is authorized *only* when accompanied by a copy of this addendum.

** 2. Permitted formats

Redistribution or sharing of the Licensed Material is permitted *only in the
following forms:*

- =.org= (Org mode)
- =.txt= (strict plaintext)

** 3. Restrictions on permitted formats

Redistribution in =.org= or =.txt= formats is allowed only if the content
remains strict plaintext, meaning:
- No Markdown syntax (nor Markdown derivatives, ie. CommonMark, Github-flavored
  Markdown, etc.)
- No LaTeX or TeX code
- No HTML, XML, or other markup tags
- No embedded code blocks in *any* programming language
- No binary content or disguised files (e.g., a PDF renamed as =.txt=)
- Only standard Org formatting and plain text are allowed in =.org= or =.txt=
  files:
  + Only headings, lists, plain text, and basic inline markup (bold, italic,
    underline, verbatim, links) as defined in the GNU Emacs Org Mode manual are
    allowed in =.org= files.
  + Tables are permitted only in their plain ASCII form (rows of | and -
    characters). They must not include formulas, dynamic fields, or export
    directives.
  + All other features, including but not limited to embedded code blocks, LaTeX
    fragments, or export directives, are prohibited.
- Files *must* be encoded as UTF-8 plaintext.

Any attempt to circumvent these format restrictions, whether by obfuscation,
renaming, or embedding prohibited content, constitutes a violation of this
license.

** 4. Prohibited formats

Redistribution or sharing of the Licensed Material *in any other format or
medium is prohibited,* including *but not limited to:*
- PDF (=.pdf=)
- LaTeX source (=.tex=)
- Rich Text (=.rtf=)
- Microsoft Word (=.doc=, =.docx=)
- OpenDocument formats (=.odt=, =.ods=)
- Markdown (=.md=)
- HTML or web formats (=.html=, =.htm=)

** 5. Publication rights

The Licensor reserves all rights to publish, distribute, or authorize
redistribution of the Licensed Material in any format other than =.txt= or
=.org= as defined above.
