#+title: License Addendum – Limited Derivative Rights

This project is licensed under the *Creative Commons
Attribution–NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)*
license, *supplemented by the following additional stipulations, which shall
prevail in case of conflict.*

For the purposes of this Addendum:
- "Strict plaintext" means UTF-8 encoded text without markup other than what is
  explicitly permitted in Section 3.
- "Redistribution" means any act of sharing, copying, transmitting, or making
  available the Licensed Material to third parties, whether privately or
  publicly.
- "Natural languages" refers to human spoken languages used by communities (eg.
  English, Persian, and Greek). Constructed languages (eg. Esperanto and Toki
  Pona) and all programming languages and domain-specific languages are /not/
  considered natural languages.
- The "Licensor" refers specifically to the original maintainer of this
  repository: /Zachari Khayati Darian./

* 1. Grant of Limited Derivative Rights

Notwithstanding Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the base license, the Licensor hereby
grants a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and royalty-free right to
create derivative works of the Licensed Material solely under the following
conditions:
- Derivative works must be created and shared exclusively in the following
  formats: =.org= (Org mode) and =.txt= (strict plaintext).
- Derivative works created under this exception must themselves remain subject
  to this License and Addendum.
- The Licensor guarantees that all contributors of accepted derivative works
  will be credited by name (or chosen pseudonym) both within the repository
  itself and in any officially published edition of the Licensed Material.

* 2. Redistribution

Redistribution or sharing of the Licensed Material is permitted *only in the
following forms:*

- =.org= (Org mode)
- =.txt= (strict plaintext)

Redistribution is authorized *only* when accompanied by an unaltered copy of the
base license together with an unaltered copy of this addendum.

* 3. Restrictions on permitted formats

Redistribution in =.org= or =.txt= formats is allowed only if the content
remains strict plaintext, meaning:
- No Markdown syntax (nor Markdown derivatives, ie. CommonMark, Github-flavored
  Markdown, etc.)
- No LaTeX or TeX code
- No HTML, XML, or other markup tags
- No embedded code blocks in *any* programming language
- No binary content or disguised files (e.g., a PDF renamed as =.txt=, or
  material converted into or hidden within another media format such as an image
  or audio file)
- Only standard Org formatting and plain text are allowed in =.org= or =.txt=
  files:
  + Only headings, lists, timestamps, checkboxes, =TODO= and =DONE= keywords,
    plain text in natural languages (as defined above), and basic inline markup
    (bold, italic, underline, verbatim, links) as defined in the GNU Emacs Org
    Mode manual are allowed in =.org= files.
  + For the avoidance of doubt, specialized orthographic forms (including but
    not limited to Persian glyph variants such as ڤ, ڡ, ۆ, ێ, and diacritic
    usage) and liturgical or metrical notation (including but not limited to
    parallage markers, verse dividers, and custom symbols for chant or rhythm)
    are considered integral to the natural-language content and are expressly
    permitted. Such features shall not be construed as markup or prohibited
    code. The Licensor may extend this list of permitted orthographic or
    liturgical symbols in the repository’s documentation without constituting a
    modification of this license.
  + Tables are permitted only in their plain ASCII form (rows of =|= and =-=
    characters). They must not include formulas, dynamic fields, or export
    directives.
  + All other features, including but not limited to embedded code blocks, LaTeX
    fragments, or export directives, are prohibited.
- Files *must* be encoded as UTF-8 plaintext.

Any attempt to circumvent these format restrictions, whether by obfuscation,
renaming, or embedding prohibited content, constitutes a violation of this
license. Violation of any part of this addendum shall be considered a violation
of the base license and shall be subject to its terms of termination.

* 4. Prohibited formats

Redistribution or sharing of the Licensed Material *in any other format or
medium is prohibited,* including *but not limited to:*
- PDF (=.pdf=)
- LaTeX source (=.tex=)
- Rich Text (=.rtf=)
- Microsoft Word (=.doc=, =.docx=)
- OpenDocument formats (=.odt=, =.ods=)
- Markdown (=.md=)
- HTML or web formats (=.html=, =.htm=)
